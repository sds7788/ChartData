# Automated Chart and Q&A Generation Task Configuration (Expanded & Rebalanced)
# ==================================================
# Define all tasks to be generated here.
# Each task is an entry with three keys:
#   - topic: The core theme of the chart (string, English)
#   - domain: The knowledge domain of the topic (string, English)
#   - chart_type: The type of chart (string).
#     Supported types: bar, line, pie, scatter, area, radar, rose, gantt, combo_bar_line, heatmap, donut, stacked_bar, boxplot, percentage_stacked_bar, 
#     renderer: 可选项为 'matplotlib', 'pyecharts'。如果省略，默认为 'matplotlib'。
#     figsize, dpi: 仅对 matplotlib 有效。
#     complexity_steps: 生成中间版本的数量
